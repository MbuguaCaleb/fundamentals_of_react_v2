**REACT BASICS V2**

```

npx create-react-app my-appname
cd my-appname
npm start

This is a simple and elegant way to set up and create your react application without beginning everything from scratch.

```

```

index.js mounts our react app.
A component is a file that holds the logic,style,in a single place..

Holds HTML,CSS and the styling all in one place..

Everything is instanciated from APP.JS..(MAIN Component file)


React helps us return html from a normal js function.->jsx
Where react comes in.

Modularising all the components of the project into small files then rendering them
into the main project.

And therefore you have to export a component.


```

```
Class styling in react is in form of className.

This is how you name style classes in react.
